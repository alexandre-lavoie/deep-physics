# Deep-Physics
Deep-Physics is a compact TensorFlow model trained to recreate intuitive physics. Deep-Physics allows for a simple generation of dynamic environments without the use of any classical physics formulas.

# Usage
Deep-Physics can be applied to any environment. We chose to provide users with a simple javascript implementation using TensorFlow.js and P5.js. Simply clone the repository and run the index.html.

# Research Paper
A work in progress research paper can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/jmwjtzdhqrvz.

# TODO
* Astro.js - A sun, planet, and satellite environment.
* Consider more factors (attraction, friction, rotation, shape) for the model.
* Consider collisions with other objects by adding another object in the input layer.
* Mario.js - A platformer game.
