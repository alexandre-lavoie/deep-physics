# Deep-Physics
Deep-Physics is a compact TensorFlow model trained to recreate intuitive physics. Deep-Physics allows for a simple generation of dynamic environments without the use of any classical physics formulas.

# Usage
Deep-Physics can be applied to any environment. We chose to provide users with a simple javascript implementation using TensorFlow.js and P5.js. Simply clone the repository and run the index.html.

# Research Paper
We have included our [unpublished research paper](Deep_Physics.pdf) which explains the theory behind our research.
