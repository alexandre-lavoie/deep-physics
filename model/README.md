# Tensorflowjs Model
Deep-Physics is an ever expandable model. The current implementation considers position, velocity, and acceleration.

### Model 3
Third prototype with smaller model and training time. Inputs a 6 dimensional vector [px,py,vx,vy,ax,ay] and outputs a 4 dimensional vector [px,py,vx,vy].

### Model 2
Second prototype with one hour of training. Inputs a 6 dimensional vector [px,py,vx,vy,ax,ay] and outputs a 4 dimensional vector [px,py,vx,vy].

### Model 1
First prototype with very small training. Inputs a 6 dimensional vector [px,py,vx,vy,ax,ay] and outputs a 4 dimensional vector [px,py,vx,vy].
